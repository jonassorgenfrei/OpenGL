	<h1>Compute Shader - Particle Simulations (Part 1)</h1>

	<warning>
		In order to complete this chapter, you will need to be able to create an OpenGL 4.3+ context.
		The compute shaders to be discussed are only available starting in OpenGL 4.3.
		Using OpenGL 3.3 or earlier will result in errors. 
		The sample shader code will use OpenGL 4.3.
	</warning>

	<p>
		This chapter explains how to build a particle simulation using the compute shader and rendering
		the particle buffer with the OpenGL renderpipeline.
		We will build up on the concepts of the compute shader explained in the
		<a target="_blank" href="https://learnopengl.com/Guest-Articles/2022/Compute-Shaders/Introduction">
		Compute Shader - Introduction</a> chapter.
		If you want to know how to create a particle system on the CPU and render it with OpenGL using
		<a target="_blank" href="https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Rendering-Sprites">Sprites</a>
		checkout the <a target="_blank" href="https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Particles">Particles</a>
		Chapter in the In-Practice Section.
	</p>

	<p>
		To pass our data from and to the compute shader we will be using buffers. They are structures which enable 
		us to store the attributes of the particles such as positions and velocities.
		To get an introduction of what buffers in the OpenGL context are check out 
		<a target="_blank" href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Advanced-Data">Chapter Advanced Data</a>

	<p>
		Our program will include the particle numbers/indices as the input stream which we will loop over using the 
		compute shader (green circle) and query the particle data from a buffer. 
		As we will create a particle simulation with a constant amount of particles with infinit life we just need 
		two attributes for the particles namely
		<def>velocity</def> and <def>position</def>.
	</p>

	<h2>Particle Simulations</h2>
	<p>
		Particle Systems are used in computer graphics to animate/simulate a larg amount of objects. They can for example be used to
		simulate fire, smoke, water, sparks, debris or other phenomena and abstract effects.
		Basically particle systems are a set of points (particles) with individual attributes that control the behaviour of each particle.
		Typical attributes for the particles can be:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> 
			<b>position</b> a point in space, always necessary
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>velocity</b> the speed and direction of the particle
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>age</b> the time since the emission of the particles
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>life</b> the maximal age until the particles dies
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>mass</b> the weight of a particle
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The behaviour of particle systems can be controlled with forces and other parameters.
		
	</p>
	<p>
		Typically a particle simulation contains the following three stages:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>emission stage</b> one or multiple new particles will be created based on an spawning rate at one or individual locations. 
			Each of the particle's attributes is initialized (e.g. initial velocity).
			This stage can be run only once or mutliple times (e.g. every frame).
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>simulation stage</b> during the simulation stage the particle attributes will be updated based on the simulation algorithm.
			If the particles have an age and life attribute at each update all existing particle will be checked if it has exceeded its lifetime,
			in which case it will be removed from the simulation.
			Besides the calculation of the movement using physical simulations (translation of the current position) the simulation often includes 
			collision detection and handling of particles with their environment (other 3D objects)
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>rendering stage</b> rendering the particle on to the screen.
			Using shading and rendering technics (such as 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Rendering-Sprites">Sprites/textured billboards</a>)
			it's possible to render phenomena such as smoke or explosions.
			Often particles will as well just be rendered as small pixels/points.
			It's also possible to use instancing to draw a more complex object per particle e.g. small debris pieces.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Particle systems can also be used as base for hair or cloth simulation by connecting the particles with constraints keeping a 
		topologic structure.
	</p>

	<h2>Physics</h2>
	<p>
		To simulate the movement and behaviour of particles we can make use of the underlaying physics.
		A particle with a non-zero initial velocity tends to keep moving with that velocity (<def>Newton's first law</def>).
		The change of motion for particles can be mathematically represented by <def>Newton's Second law</def>, which says that the motion 
		changes whenever unbalanced external forces are applied to the particle (body).
	</p>
	<img src="img\guest\2022\compute_shader_particles\force.png" width="200px" class="clean" alt="Force calculation"/>
	<p>
		The <def>force</def> f acting on a body (particle) equals the <def>mass</def> m of the body times the <def>acceleration</def> a.
		For example the (constant) acceleration acting on every object with mass on earth is the gravity (~ 9.81 m/s^2) pulling everything
		to the center of the earth.
	</p>
	<p>
		Besides gravity there might be other forces acting on the particle. For example a particles system that simulates water requires 
		aswell internal forces for incompressibility and advection. A particle system or dust requires air currents and wind as external 
		forces.
		Forces can be constant like gravity, time dependent like wind forces, position dependent like force fields or velocity/attribute dependent
		like drag (the faster the velocity the larger the drag e.g. viscous fluids) and friction.
	</p>
	<p>
		To describe the motion itself we can use <def>velocity</def> as description of the change of position (displacement) of 
		one particle. <def>Velocity</def> describes the (displacement) distance per time interval.
		<def>Velocity</def> can be represented as a vector (dimension is depending on the coordinate system used) and it includes the speed (magnitude / length)
		of the <def>velocity</def> vector and the direction of the vector. 
		The <def>velocity</def> can be influenced by <def>forces</def> and <def>accelerations</def>.
		The speed can be uniform which means the magnitude of the <def>velocity</def> vector is constant and does not change over time. 
		If a <def>force</def> is acting on an object the <def>velocity</def> might become non uniform and differs over time.
		While uniform speed is easily to simulate and calculate for changing speed it's not that trivial and theoretically
		we would need to calculate it for every single infinitiv small time step which is not possible in our computer programm.
		But we can use a mathematicall method called <def>integration</def> to handle this problem which can help us calculate 
		the change of position for a non uniform speed.
	</p>


	<h2>Integration</h2>
	<p>
		Given a function of changing <def>velocity</def> <i>f(x)</i> one can use a methode called <def>integration</def> to calculate the area 
		under the curve which represents the traveled distance <i>s</i> in the time interval from point <i>a</i> to point <i>b</i>.
		In the image below the y axis represents the <def>velocity</def> and the x axis the time. 
		We won't go into detail how to calculate the integral at this point, if you aren't sure how to integrate make sure
		to revisit this subject in an algebra article (e.g. khanacademy).
	</p>
	<img src="img\guest\2022\compute_shader_particles\integral.png" width="200px" class="clean" alt="Integral"/>

	<p>
		Imagine a car driving with constant speed which means the way it traveles is increasing over time (left graph).
		We can calcute the <def>velocity</def> at a point in time by checking the slope at that time. 
		By calculate the derivation of the traveled distance function (left graph) we can calculate the <def>velocity</def> function
		(right graph). As derivation is the counter operation to integration we could use the integration of the 
		<def>velocity</def> as described above to calculate the traveled distance for a time interval (right graph green area).
	</p>
	<img src="img\guest\2022\compute_shader_particles\constantSpeed.png" width="400px" class="clean" alt="Constant Speed Derivation"/>
	<p>
		The image below shows this description mathematically while the green graph is the traveled distance which is proportional
		the blue graph is it's derivation (the <def>velocity</def> graph) which is constant as the slope is uniform.
		Calculating the integral of the blue graph in the interval 0 to 4 results in a value of 8 which is exactly the traveled 
		distance (green graph) at t=4. 
	</p>
	<img src="img\guest\2022\compute_shader_particles\derivation-integration.png" width="800px" class="clean" alt="Constant Speed Derivation"/>
	
	<p>
		When we check the slope of the <def>velocity</def> graph we can see that it results in a value of zero as it is constant.
		The derivation will result in a function <i>f''(x) = 0</i> which shows that the <def>velocity</def> is not being changed
		meaning we don't have any <def>acceleration</def> influencing the speed of the object.
	</p>
	<img src="img\guest\2022\compute_shader_particles\acceleration.png" width="200px" class="clean" alt="Constant Speed Derivation"/>
	<p>
		With this being said we can see that we can calculate the speed as the derivation of the displacement and 
		the <def>acceleration</def> as the derivation of the <def>velocity</def>. We can use this fact to create our simulation in the step below.
	</p>

	<h3>Euler Integration</h3>
	<p>
		Using a methode called (explicit) <def>Euler Integration</def> we can simulation the motion of particles using a <def>numerical method</def>.
		With <def>numerical method</def> we get an approximation of the solution, NOT the exact solution and the calculation of the solution is 
		incrementally, <b>step by step</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Given the initial position, velocity and force acting on e.g. a particle the euler method gives the approximation for 
		the solution of the differential equations presented above.
		As the motion of particles is not always easily representable by a simple equations and in general is more chaotic (like a noise)
		it's (in general) not possible to calculate the motion of particles analytically. 
		The Euler method uses successive time steps (Δt) to approximate the position change of the particles.
		The graph below shows the change in velocity and as presented above the area under the graph shows the displacement.
	</p>
	<img src="img\guest\2022\compute_shader_particles\timeSteps.png" width="400px" class="clean" alt="Time Steps"/>
	<p>
		Focusing on one time step we can see that the area under the graph (which represents the displacement of the particle)
		can be approximated by the sum of a rectangular area (blue) and a triangular area (green).
		To calculate the rectangular (blue) area we can simply multiple the <def>velocity</def> at this moment (e.g. v0) by the size 
		of the time step (Δt).
		To calculate the triangle on top we need to calculate the slope of the <def>velocity</def> at that point, which can be calculated using the
		derivate of the <def>velocity</def>, the <def>acceleration</def>. 
		Using the the Euler's Method we are assuming the <def>acceleration</def> (the 2nd derivate of the displacement) is constant during the timestep we can integrate the <def>acceleration</def> which is a constant value. 
		(Remember the <def>acceleration</def> acting on a particle is the sum of the <def>forces</def> which influce the particle divided by the mass of
		it).
		Integrating the constant acceleration  by the time step (Δt) we get the change ratio of the velocity to the next time step (=a*Δt | yellow line).
		Mutliplying this value by the the time step (Δt) and dividing it by 2 we get the area of the green triangle. Which is the displacement due to 
		the change of velocity during the time step. 
	</p>
	<img src="img\guest\2022\compute_shader_particles\timeStep1.png" width="400px" class="clean" alt="Time Steps"/>
	<p>
		The following equation shows the calculation of the displacement described in the previous paragraph.
		The first part of the sum represents the rectangular area and the second term the triangular area.
		The whole sum approximates the area under the graph (the integral) for the specific time step.
	</p>
	<img src="img\guest\2022\compute_shader_particles\displacementEquation.png" width="250px" class="clean" alt="Displacement Equation"/>
	<p>
		Because the Euler integration is explicit, which means that the state of a system at a later step is calculated from the state of the system at
		the current step we can simply use the old Position (P0) and add the calculated displacement to get the next Position (P1).

	</p>
	<img src="img\guest\2022\compute_shader_particles\positionIntegrationEquation.png" width="250px" class="clean" alt="Position Integration Equation"/>
	<p>
		Repeating this step we can calculate the ongoing motion of our individual particles.
		Additionally we have to calculate the velocity for the next step too. Which can be calculated by adding the change ratio of velocity (which we get by integrating
		the (constant) acceleration) to the current velocity.
	</p>
	<img src="img\guest\2022\compute_shader_particles\velocityIntegration.png" width="150px" class="clean" alt="Position Integration Equation"/>
	<p>
		Unfortunatly the downsides of the Euler's Method is that it's inaccurate based on the size of the timesteps and goes therefore 
		often unstable.
		Espacially when choosing the time step too big. If the time step is to small the simulation get computationally heavy as more operations 
		have to being executed.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		In the next section we will bring this into practice by building our particle simulation on the compute shader.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Create the Particle Simulation</h2>
	<p>
	In this section we will put everything into practice and create our OpenGL Particle Simulation.
	</p>

	<p>
		We start by creating a few constansts which we will later refer to in our implementation. 
		We start with a constant which contains the amount of particles to create and a second constant to 
	</p>

	<h3>Create the Compute Shader</h3>
	<p>

	</p>

	<h2>Final Words</h2>
	<p>
		In this chapter we learned how we can use uniform buffers to store arbitrary data (in this case particle data) and created a simulation using the compute shader.
		Having the data already on the GPU we were able to reuse the uniform buffer to directly render the simulated particles using the default OpenGL Graphics pipeline.
	</p>

	<p>
		This implementation only allows us to create a constant amount of particles with infinit life. In Part 2 of Compute Shader Particles Simulation we will have a look on how to create more complex particle simulations with aging which 
		requires us on doing some more complicated memory management on our buffers to have particles die and new particles to be spawned.
